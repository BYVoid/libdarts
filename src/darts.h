 it will be called in darts_build() so that the caller can check the progress of

 key[key_pos + i], traverse() terminates the transitions at that state and
 returns -2. Otherwise, traverse() ends without a termination and returns
 -1 or a nonnegative value, -1 indicates that the final state was not an
 accept state. When a nonnegative value is returned, it is the value
 associated with the final accept state. That is, traverse() returns the
 value associated with the given key if it exists. Note that traverse()
 updates `node_pos' and `key_pos' after each transition.
